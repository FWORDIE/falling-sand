**WELCOME TO FALLING ABCs**

It is like any other falling sand simulator except this one works with letters

Each letter has its own unique properties and behaviours

There are two modes

**BRUSH MODE**

Here you can brush different elements onto the canvas using your mouse and keyboard

**TEXT MODE**

Here the simulation pauses while you type in your elements or copy and paste in text

Then you press ENTER to run the simulation

*DOES NOT WORK ON MOBILE*

This falling sand simulator is inspired by The Coding Train and Jason Today
